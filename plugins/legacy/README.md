# Legacy Plugins

These plugins are untested for the new multi architecture version of ICEmu.
Most likely they will work fine after changing `armaddr_t` to `address_t` but
I did not have time to test them.

Hopefully they will slowly move back to the main `plugins` directory after I tested
them (assuming they are useful, which not all of them are).
